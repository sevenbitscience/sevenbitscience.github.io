# Preface
This is the second post in the "Hobby Programming" series.
I hoped to get another article out a week after the first one went out, but I have ended up spending more time on this project than I anticipated, but mostly data collection.

# Intro

Over the past few years, I have become super interested in all kinds of radio communications.
My interest started off with the RTL-SDR. I could spend hours tuning around various radio bands, just to see what was around.
One of the first projects to do with an SDR is tracking planes by receiving ADS-B messages.
ADS-B transponders are present on basically all commercial airplanes, and are fairly easy to pick up with an RTL-SDR receiver.
What really helps to make these easy to pick up is that planes are typically in the sky, making line of sight pretty easy to achieve.
With ADS-B, you can track planes in real time and even get some other info from them including callsign, registration numbers, altitude, speed, and more.
It's all telemetry data, and is only mildly interesting to set up on your own because there are already readily available flight tracking services such as [airplanes.live](https://globe.airplanes.live) or [FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com).

Another kind of aviation transponder that I hadn't looked at until recently is ACARS.

# What is ACARS

ACARS is a system used by pilots as well as ground stations for sending short messages via VHF or satellite frequencies.
The entry for [ACARS on the SigID Wiki](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Aircraft_Communications_Addressing_and_Reporting_System_(ACARS)) was helpful for getting an idea of what frequencies I needed to look on.
I had heard that sometimes pilots will send text messages using this system, and I was particularly interesting if I could pick up any notably interesting or humorous messages.
Additionally, listening in on ACARS could also give a glimpse into some of the more mundane things that pilots message about.
It looked like there are two main "bands" where ACARS communications frequently take place, around 131.000 MHz and another region around 136.750 MHz.

|Frequency|Note|
|:-------:|:--:|
|129.125  |USA and Canada Additional|
|130.025  |USA and Canada Secondary|
|130.425  |USA Additional|
|130.450  |USA and Canada Additional|
|131.125  |USA Additional|
|131.550  |World Primary|
|136.700  |USA Additional|
|136.750  |USA Additional|
|136.800  |USA Additional|
|136.850  |SITA North America|

_Adapted from frequency chart on [SigID Wiki](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Aircraft_Communications_Addressing_and_Reporting_System_(ACARS))_

Interestingly, I saw very little traffic on the 136.750 MHz band, and I did not record any messages on those frequencies.
After looking at the amount of traffic on the different frequencies around 131.000 MHz, I decided to record data from the following frequencies:

- 130.025 MHz
- 130.425 MHz
- 130.450 MHz
- 131.125 MHz
- 131.550 MHz

I chose these because it looked like they had the most activity and they fit inside the ~2 MHz bandwidth of my RTL-SDR.

# Software setup

Used [acarsdec](https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsdec) to decode the ACARS packets.
I built it from source on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running headlessly.
Weirdly, I had some trouble connecting to it over SSH.
I'm not really sure why this is, but the connection seemed to freeze after a few seconds after connecting to it.
Because of that, I mostly used Raspberry Pi Connect to remote into the Pi, which had the benefit of allowing me to connect to it even if I was away from my home network.

Initially I set up acarsdec to record the messages to a log file which it would rotate daily to break it into more manageable chunks.
To get these files to a local machine to dig through the data, I set up a Samba share on the Raspberry Pi.
The first day of logs was 3.2 MiB in size and mostly full of junk data, or rather data that was junk to me.
A huge amount of the data (as I would quantify later) was just automated telemetry and maintenance data. 
Because I was only really looking for data that was in a text format, I looked for a way to filter out the telemetry data.
I found that ACARS messages send a label with them that describes what the data in the message is.
Like a fair number of aspects with ACARS data, documentation is not incredibly through or easy to find.
Using a couple of sources, primarily [this PDF](https://rotate.aero/media/kunena/attachments/936/acars.pdf) I compiled a list of labels which seemed interesting.
I have included the list here,

```text
14, 48, 39, 54, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, C0, C#, 5Z, B9, 7B
```

I let the decoder run for about 2 weeks, checking in every couple of days to dig through the logs.
The files were fairly large for text data roughly 50 KiB each.
It was suboptimal to dig through these in just a text editor, scrolling through the lines and lines of text or searching for potentially common words.
Yet still, I will include a couple interesting messages here.

A final note for this section, acarsdec is what creates the headers that I have included with the messages.

# High time for a database

It was obviously evident that this method was absolutely unfit for storing and searching the ACARS data.
The obvious solution to this problem was to use a database to store the data.
That way I could efficiently search through the data, something more elegant than just scrolling through a big text file.
I had not sprung to use a database before because I wanted to get something up and running quickly, and I have never used SQL before.
But at this point in the project, I decided to use this as a learning experience and dive into SQL.

Luckily, other people have already thought about this and Thierry Leconte has created a program called [acarsserv](https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsserv) which connects to acarsdec or even [vdlm2dec](https://github.com/TLeconte/vdlm2dec) with UDP and stores messages, flights, and ground station info in a sqlite3 database.
After building on the raspberry pi remotely, I set up acarsdec to output the messages to a UDP connection and have acarsserv listen and store them.

```bash
$ acarsserv -j 127.0.0.1:5555 -b acarsserv.sqlite &
$ acarsdec -o 0 -j 127.0.0.1:5555 -r 0 136.700 136.750 136.800 136.850 &
$ disown -h
```

I let the server run for approximately 10 days before beginning to dig through the results.

I started by looking up some information on basic SQL usage.
Quickly, I was able to filter by labels, count the number of results, and more.
I also asked [Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) for some help with some of the SQL queries.

I started off by just using the `sqlite3` command to get an interactive command line to run SQL commands.
First I looked at some basic statistics. In total I collected 22,307 messages from 6,952 flights between June 30th and July 10th.
One thing I started with was looking at some statistics of what kinds of messages I saw most commonly.

Number of Messages, Sorted by Label

|Label|Messages|
|:---:|:------:|
| H1 | 15607 |
| 5Z | 1241 | 
| 32 | 887 |  
| 21 | 820 |  
| 22 | 768 |  
| B9 | 562 |  
| 16 | 335 |  
| 33 | 226 |  
| 11 | 202 |  
| 37 | 159 |  
| 24 | 140 |  
| SA | 137 |  
| 15 | 132 |  

The most popular label I saw was H1, which as I discussed before are messages with miscellaneous telemetry and maintenance data.
Those H1 messages made up nearly 70% of all of the messages I collected.
Behind H1 in popularity is 5Z, which is generally flight plan information as well as some plain text messages.
32,21, and 22 are all telemetry data.
Interestingly, while 21 and 22 both appear to be only used by Frontier airlines for telemetry.
Here is a snippet of what some Label 21 messages look like:

```text
POSN 38.071W 77.841, 132,232924,35231,33323,  13,-43,002336,KSYR

POSN 38.042W 78.581, 146,012842,32327,34838,  11,-37,020400,KPHL
```

It's fairly clear that these messages are sending some position data.
They all begin with POS, then coordinates marked with `N ##.###W ##.###`.
I thought it would be neat to plot out all of these messages on a map.
My first instincts for this would be to turn to python for some quick scripting, but I didn't know how to chart a map in python or how to communicate with a database.
So instead to quickly whip something up I asked Gemini.
I gave it a fairly extensive description of what I wanted to do and it quickly wrote up some code.

Unfortunately, I made a mistake when I prompted it.
I gave it some sample data so it could see what the messages looked like, but I left in the column with the FlightID, so it got confused. 
I changed it's code slightly to get it to work, but other than that it worked perfectly!

And when I ran the code I got out an HTML file with a beautiful map!

![Screenshot of a map with many lines and points showing positions reported by the acars messages](/assets/images/acars1.png)

And after changing the code to work with the label 22 messages, which only differ slightly, I got another very similar looking map.

![Screenshot of a map with lines and points in the same positions, but different colors](/assets/images/acars2.png)

This surprised me, so I double checked my code to make sure I was actually changed the SQL query, but it really was different.
It turns out that both kinds of messages are sending the same data, just in different formats!
I suspect that this is for redundancy, but I don't really know.

I was surprised at how well Gemini was able to get 99% of the way there on this complicated query.
However, when I tried to have it change things about the code, or fix the issue I initially created for it, it was stubborn and would seemingly randomly change other aspects of the code.
While it gave me an incredible head start, it was unhelpful for editing it's code, and I had to make any changes that I wanted manually.

That is about as far as I have gotten in processing and analysing the data, but I expect to put out a future update, looking at more text messages and maybe other data messages.
This step has taken a lot longer than I wanted, but most of the time allowed for lots of data collection.
Beyond the data I have already collected, it could also be interesting to look into satcom ACARS and VDLM2 (I have even already collected some VDLM2 data, so be on the lookout for that!)
