Amidst the wordle craze, I created my own version of the hit word game as a fun coding challange.

Here is the link to my game: [https://www.7bitsci.com/wordy/](https://www.7bitsci.com/wordy/)

My version, called Wordy, follows the same rules as wordle, you are trying to guess a 5 letter word in 6 guesses. Once you enter a guess the letters in that guess turn gray if they aren't in the word, yellow if they are in the word in the wrong spot, and green if they are in the word and in the right spot. However, in my version you can play as many times as you want each day. I do not see my game as a replacement for wordle or be better than wordle, I just saw a cool opertunity to make something. I am not using any of the code from wordle, not even the word list! In the future, I plan to add aditional challange modes you can play with to make guessing the word harder.
