I hadn't realy done any reaserch on how computers work but I had some basic knowlage on how computers work when I started this.
I was just trying to figure out how computers work on my own.  
So, today I went and looked at how [legomasta99's redstone computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbO0tqH8f5I) works to get an idea if I was going in the right direction.
I spent a while trying to figure out how it worked as it works and like after a while I figured out the first line of code.
The text file that explains it was super helpful in figuring it out.
I was mostly looking at how the memory worked and how it stores programs.
I did get pretty close, like how each operation, or as it should be called, each opcode was stored in program memory.  
Anyways, I am going to change how the program memory is laid out and some other stuff, using legomasta99's computer as reference.
So, I'll post another update when I do that as I am going to change a bunch of stuff and I will try to use more correct termonology from now on.
